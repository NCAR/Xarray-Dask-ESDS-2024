    "* Dask is an open-source Python library for parallel and distributed computing that scales the existing Python ecosystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Dask was developed to scale Python packages such as Numpy, Pandas, and Xarray to multi-core machines and distributed clusters when datasets exceed memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Dask?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Familiar Interface \n",
    "\n",
    "Dask provides interfaces which mimics significant portions of the NumPy and Pandas APIs. \n",
    "\n",
    "This means Dask provides ways to parallelize Pandas, Xarray, and Numpy workflows with minimal code rewriting (no massive code-restructure or writing a script in another language). In the previous tutorial, we learned how Xarray can wrap other NumPy-like arrays. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Scalability\n",
    "Dask is designed to scale well from single machine (laptop) to thousand-node HPC clusters, and on the cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows users to use their existing hardware, or add more machines as needed, to handle increasingly large and complex datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Flexibility\n",
    "Dask provides several tools that help with data analysis on large datasets. For example, you can easily wrap your function in `dask.delayed` decorator to make it run in parallel. \n",
    "\n",
    "Dask provides seamless integration with well-known HPC resource managers and job scheduling systems, including PBS, SLURM, and SGE.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Built-in Diagnostic Tools\n",
    "Dask provides responsive feedback via the client as well as a real-time interactive diagnostic dashboard to keep users informed on how the computation is progressing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This helps users identify and resolve potential issues without waiting for the work to be completed. \n",
    "\n",
    "## When to use Dask?\n",
    "Here are some general guidelines for when to use Dask and when to avoid it:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use Dask:\n",
    "* When you have large datasets that don't fit into memory on a single machine.\n",
    "* When you need to perform parallel computations, such as big data analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Avoid Dask:\n",
    "\n",
    "* When you have small datasets that can be processed efficiently on a single machine.\n",
    "* When you don't need parallel processing, as the overhead of managing a distributed computing environment may not be worth the benefits.\n",
    "* When you need to debug or troubleshoot problems, as distributed computing environments can be challenging for debugging. If the problem is complex, using Dask may make debugging more difficult."

    "## Dask Components\n",
    "\n",
    "Dask is composed of two main parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.  Dask Collections\n",
    "\n",
    "Dask *Collections* are the user interfaces we use for parallel and distributed computing with Dask.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dask features different levels of collection types:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### High-level collections \n",
    "Dask provides high-level collections Dask Arrays, Dask DataFrames, and Dask Bags that mimic NumPy, pandas, and lists but can operate in parallel on datasets that don’t fit into memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the time, you will probably use one of the following *high-level* (big) data structures (or an even higher-level derivative type like Xarrays):\n",
    "\n",
    "| Collection | Serial | Dask |\n",
    "|-|-|-|\n",
    "| Arrays | numpy.array | dask.array.from_array |\n",
    "| Dataframes | pandas.read_csv | dask.dataframe.read_csv |\n",
    "| Unstructured | [1,2,3] | dask.bag.from_sequence([1,2,3]) |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Low-level collections\n",
    "Dask also features two *low-level* collection types - `delayed` and `futures`.  These collections give users finer control to build custom parallel and distributed computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **delayed** - run any arbitrary Python function using Dask task parallelism (think looped function calls)\n",
    "* **futures** - similar to delayed but allows for concurrent commands in the client script (think backgrounded processes)\n",
    "\n",
    "These are very powerfull tools, but it is easy to write something using a delayed function that could be executed faster and more simply using a high-level collection \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Dynamic Task Scheduling\n",
    "**We can basically think of the Dask scheduler as our task orchestrator.**\n",
    "\n",
    "When a computation is submitted, work is segmented into discrete tasks which are assigned to workers by the Dask scheduler. \n",
    "\n",
    "To perform work, a scheduler must be assigned resources in the form of a Dask cluster. The cluster consists of the following components: \n",
    "\n",
    "* **scheduler** : A scheduler creates and manages task graphs and distributes tasks to workers.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **workers** : A worker is typically a separate Python process on either the local host or a remote machine. A Dask cluster usually consists of many workers. Basically, a worker is a Python interpretor which will perform work on a subset of our dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **client** - A high-level interface that points to the scheduler (often local but not always). A client serves as the entry point for interacting with a Dask scheduler.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://tutorial.dask.org/_images/distributed-overview.png\"\n",
    "     width=\"75%\"\n",
    "     alt=\"Dask Distributed Cluster\"/>\n",
    "     \n",
    "*Image credit: Anaconda, Inc. and contributors*\n",

    "We will learn more about Dask Collections and Dynamic Task Scheduling in the next tutorials."

    "## Starting HPC Dask clusters with `dask-jobqueue`\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Using Dask on an HPC system is no different - we need to interact with the scheduler to provide Dask with ample compute resources. We *could* first start a job with multiple cores and a large amount of memory, and then use the **LocalCluster** to spawn workers. However, this approach only scales to a single node.\n",

So essentially `persist` turns a lazy Dask collection into a Dask collection where the results are either fully computed or actively computing in the background.\n",

This allows the cluster to dynamically scale up and down based on the (Dask) scheduler's estimation of resource needs. This capability is highly customizable, but one basic method would be to set bounds on the number of worker jobs that can be used:\n",
